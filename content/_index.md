This is my personal page. Here you will find information about me and, from time to time, some blog posts about topics that interest me – tipically about Machine Learning, Statistical Physics, Bayesian Inference, and functional programming or sofware related stuff in general – and a few comments on other topics. Most of the posts are in English, but some things in Portuguese might pop out every now and then.
